🔹 Section 1: What Are Cyber Laws?

1. Introduction to Cyber Laws
   Cyber laws are a set of legal guidelines designed to protect individuals, businesses, and governments from crimes committed in the digital space. With the rapid growth of technology, cyber threats such as identity theft, financial fraud, hacking, and online harassment have become common. The Indian government has introduced laws to regulate online behavior, protect data, and ensure digital safety for all.

2. Why Cyber Laws Matter?
   Rising Cybercrimes: India has witnessed a 300% increase in cybercrime cases in recent years. From phishing scams to ransomware attacks, online threats continue to evolve.
   Data Protection: Every time you shop online, use social media, or store personal data on the cloud, cyber laws ensure that your privacy is safeguarded.
   Legal Protection: Understanding cyber laws helps you know your rights and how to take action if you become a victim of cybercrime.

🔹 Section 2: Key Features of Indian Cyber Laws

 IT Act 2000 (Information Technology Act)
The IT Act 2000 is India’s primary law governing cyber activities. It regulates electronic transactions, cybercrimes, and digital signatures. The law has been amended over time to address modern threats like data breaches, cyberstalking, and online defamation.

🔹 Data Protection & Privacy
With increasing concerns over data misuse, India is working on strict data protection regulations. Cyber laws define how organizations should collect, store, and protect user information. The Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act is a recent step towards safeguarding personal data.

🔹 Cybercrimes & Penalties
Common cyber offenses in India include:

Hacking (Section 66B IT Act) – Up to 3 years imprisonment & fines.
Online Defamation (Section 499 IPC) – Legal action for spreading false information online.
Financial Fraud (Section 66C IT Act) – Punishable for using stolen credit card or bank details.
Cyberstalking & Harassment – Strict legal actions against online harassment, especially targeting women and children

🔹 Section 3: Your Rights & Responsibilities

Your Digital Rights (Access to information, privacy, freedom of expression)
How to Stay Safe Online (Best practices for cybersecurity)
Call-to-Action (CTA)
